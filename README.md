## Installation


## Usage

### Components

Wagtail Regulations provides the building blocks to create and serve 
interactive US federal regulations on existing Wagtail sites. 
It is intended to integrate into sites that may have their base templates, 
design language and components, and Wagtail base pages. It also provides 
everything needed to stand-up a new interactive regulations site using the 
US Web Design System.

The basic components are as follows:

#### Regulation content

Wagtail Regulations includes Django models that represent regulations, their 
effective versions, subparts, and sections. 

Regulation content is stored in `Section` objects in  Markdown outside of the 
Wagtail page tree.

#### Regulation pages

Regulation pages are routable Wagtail pages that live in the Wagtail page 
tree and serve the regulation content from the 
[regulation content](#regulation-content). Regulation pages can be used two 
ways:

1. By inheriting from the abstract `wagtailregulations.RegulationPage` model 
   directly.
2. By creating a new page model using any `Page` subclass and 
   `RegulationPageMixin`.


#### Regulation search

Regulation content is indexed and searchable using Haystack.


#### Regulation API

The API provides access to the regulation pages and their content so that a 
frontend can consume it.


#### Frontend

The frontend serves the regulation content and search to end users.


#### eCFR Parser



### Putting it all together

This repository comes with the Wagtail library to build an interative federal 
regulations website as well as a functioning example of how to do so. 

The example is broken into a Wagtail-based REST API and a Gatsy-based 
front-end using the US Web Design System v2.0 that consumes that API.

#### API

The API can be run using 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) with 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):

```
docker-compose up
```

To load example regulation data with the necessary Wagtail pages:

```
docker-compose run app /venv/bin/python manage.py loaddata sample_data.json
```

The regulation data should then be available at http://localhost:8000/api/v2/pages/4
